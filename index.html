    <p>Thank you for choosing C2C, the time organizing program developed by Claror. However, Claror does not want to be known for just one program, C2C; We plan to make other programs and are also aiming for some hardware as we have experience in building computers.</p>
    <p>We hope you find our other projects interesting and inspire you to try out our most recent project.</p>
    <p>Our previous projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A robotic operating arm</li>
    <li>An extremely powerful and capable calculator</li>
    <li>Remote home system (can control LEDs, cameras, doorbells, speakers and other home appliances.)</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Claror is a technical organisation that has released one computer program so far. It prioritises when you will do your chores, but please remember it is still in development. The project has been created over nine months, and we plan for it to give you a more organised life.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Please take the survey or we won't know what to change to make it the best experience we can offer to you as an induvidual.</p>
   <p>-Thank You</p>
